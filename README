# README for a newly created project.

There are a couple of things you should do first, before you can use all of Git's power:

  * Add a remote to this project: in the Cloud9 IDE command line, you can execute the following commands
    `git remote add [remote name] [remote url (eg. 'git@github.com:/ajaxorg/node_chat')]` [Enter]
  * Create new files inside your project
  * Add them to to Git by executing the following command
    `git add [file1, file2, file3, ...]` [Enter]
  * Create a commit which can be pushed to the remote you just added
    `git commit -m 'added new files'` [Enter]
  * Push the commit the remote
    `git push [remote name] master` [Enter]
